# ðŸ’¬E-Commerce Chatbot

This is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** for an intelligent chatbot designed for an e-commerce platform. The chatbot enables seamless user interactions by accurately identifying the intent behind user queries. It leverages real-time access to the platform's database, allowing it to provide precise and up-to-date responses.

This chatbot currently supports three intents:

**1. faq**: Handles frequently asked questions related to the platform's policies or general information.
> _"Is online payment available?"_



**2. sql**: Activated when users request product listings or information based on real-time database queries.
> _"Show me all Nike shoes below Rs. 3000."_



**3. smalltalk**: Responds to casual or conversational messages to make the chatbot more engaging and human-like.
> _"How are you?"_  

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- Intent classification using NLP
- Real-time database querying
